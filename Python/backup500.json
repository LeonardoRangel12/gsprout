        "descripcion": "Language Packs About the Game In the space-colony simulation game Oxygen Not Included you\u2019ll find that scarcities of oxygen, warmth and sustenance are constant threats to your colony's survival. Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but thriving... Just make sure you don't forget to breathe. Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive: Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live. It\u2019s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost. Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists. Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine. Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly. Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis. Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food. If you\u2019re clever, you might even be able to run a base off colonist farts. Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds: Summon new worlds with a push of a button. Experience tons of untamed space rocks, then suffocate to death in them! ",

A mutating, alien menace threatens the last remnants of mankind. Only the Phoenix Project, a secret organization of the best minds and bravest soldiers left on earth, can repel the invasion and reverse the inevitable. The Phoenix Project looks to you for leadership. Research and develop new technologies, explore a ravaged globe, build your bases, manage resources, and dominate the battlefield. Just remember: you're not alone out there. Factions, including the corporatist New Jericho, the indecisive Synedrion, and the fanatical Disciples of Anu, as well as a variety of offshoot subfactions, have their own values, goals, and view of the Pandorans. Work with these factions via Phoenix Point's diplomacy system, use subterfuge to steal what you need from them, or simply crush all around you with military might. No matter what you choose, victory won't be easy. Phoenix Point Features: Tons of Content: Over two years of updates, upgrades, fixes, and new content suggested by our community, including Steam Workshop support for subscribing and enabling mods, tweaking existing mods, and setting up your game the way you want to play.

It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them. Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass. Next-Gen Tech with Classic Pedigree: Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Integrating the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class. ",

        "descripcion": "Hear a Tale or Spin Your Own About the Game Wildermyth is a character-driven, procedurally-generated tactical RPG. Like the best tabletop roleplaying experiences, Wildermyth gives you choices and answers your every decision with consequences that drive your characters forward. Lead a band of heroes as they grow from reluctant farmers into unique, legendary fighters. Combat unexpected threats and strange monsters across interactive battlefields. Unravel mysteries and share pensive moments in an ever-new fantasy setting that blends hard truths and sacrifice with humor and personal storytelling. Where does your myth lead? Come help us uncover it! Reminiscent of tabletop roleplaying, unique heroes are born in unique settings every game. They age, transform, fall in love, disagree, and make harrowing sacrifices. Each hero brings their own organic history and personality with them, but your choices and combat skills are what decide their paths and outcomes. All heroes die someday\u2026 but you get to hold on to your favorites. Reintroduce them in the next adventure, and over many lifetimes the myths you make will form your own legendary pantheon. An Imaginative Papercraft World The Yondering Lands, where the game is set, is a richly layered world populated with hand-painted 2D characters and scenery. We\u2019ve paid loving attention to breaking molds and exploring new ideas: no orcs, elves, or goblins here\u2014but watch out for the telepathic insect-dragons and the clockwork undead. Extreme Character Depth Each of your heroes has their own unique generated history, personality, and appearance, and will form relationships with your other heroes. All of these elements change and develop over the course of a playthrough, as characters age, encounter mysteries, and overcome challenges. Choices That Matter Your hero may choose to trust the enigmatic wolf god, leading to a hair-raising change in their appearance and combat abilities. Or they may pursue a romance with a fellow hero, giving each of them a shared buff and more story opportunities. Encounters and events have permanent, character-defining effects, letting you craft the arc of each character. A New Approach to Death Did your favorite character get one-shotted by a tentacled horror-bear? Choose to let a hero 'fall back' with a maiming that will lead to some transformative new paths in their legend, or let them go out in a blaze of glory to be remembered for generations to come. Deep and Creative Tactical Combat Combat in Wildermyth emphasizes teamwork and careful positioning, as well as imaginative use of your evolving capabilities and surroundings. Walling and Flanking mechanics provide clear but conflicting incentives, while mystical interfusion lets you remake the battlefield with explosive magic. Multiple difficulty levels mean you can get as intense as you want to. Cooperative Multiplayer In a multiplayer game, you and your friends can each customize and control your own heroes as you play through a campaign. Recommended for up to five players\u2014though in a typical campaign, you start with three heroes and pick up the fourth and fifth along the way. We also support Steam Remote Play. Endless Replayability Pick and choose from a huge bank of combat abilities as your heroes level up in each playthrough, and decide whether you prefer offensive or defensive tactics, brute strength, stealth, or magically flinging fire from a nearby lamp into your enemies' faces. Procedural generation gives you new heroes, new enemies, new story events, and new maps every time you play. A Custom Pantheon of Legends You\u2019ll have the freedom to customize hero appearances, names, histories, and more. As time passes, heroes grow old and may retire, or else might fall in combat\u2014and yes, some will survive all the way to the end. You can add your favorite heroes to a roster of legends and call on them again in later playthroughs. Build your own mythologies and share the awe-inspiring might of your heroes with others. ",

Engineer Isaac Clarke embarks on the repair mission, only to uncover a nightmarish blood bath \u0097 the ship's crew horribly slaughtered and infected by alien scourge. Now Isaac is cut off, trapped, and engaged in a desperate fight for survival. Strategically dismember the Necromorph enemies limb by bloody limb. Zero gravity combat means terror can strike from anywhere. Uncover the horrific truth of this shocking thriller. Game Features: Messy monster slaying The Necromorphs are unlike any enemies you've seen before. Headshots do about as much damage to them as flicking rubber bands. To survive, you'll need to dismember their insect-like limbs, one at a time. Improvised weapons There aren't many traditional firearms aboard the Ishimura, but there's plenty of stopping power in Isaac's toolkit. Send horizontal or vertical blasts of energy at enemies with the Plasma Cutter, remotely control a high-speed sawblade with the Disc Ripper, and fill hallways with wide swaths of destruction with the Line Gun. Switch things up with alternate fire modes, and purchase upgrades to increase ammo, power, and reload speed. Real-time attacks. Whatever you do, don\u2019t drop your guard. Everything takes place in real-time. That means any action you take, whether it be reloading or digging through your inventory, gives the Necromorphs a perfect opportunity to attack. This nightmare has just begun and it\u2019s up to get to the bottom of what happened here. ",

Take control of the Arbiter Kyrie, an agent of the Immortal Council tasked with preserving stability and order throughout the land, and lead your troops through difficult encounters. Experience an epic and mature story , unfolding through over 40 story encounters and topped with challenging end-game content. Classic tactical combat battles , with rugged terrain and elevation, taking place on beautiful hand-drawn environments. A deep and complex class system with over 30 classes and 300 abilities lets you truly customize every one of your characters through the selection of their class, sub-class and passives.

Customize your troops' appearance your way, by selecting their portrait, outfit, colors and overall visuals from a wide selection. Equip your army with over 240 pieces of equipment, either purchased, gathered from fallen enemies or created from crafting. Centuries ago, a brutal beast of destruction rent the world asunder. In this time of need, the first Immortals came into their uncanny powers, powers so great that they succeeded in destroying the beast ravaging the land, where all else had failed. To prevent such destruction from ever happening again, the Immortals banded together to form a Council that would enforce order and stability on a global scale, stepping in at any hint of war or chaos. The Immortals might be vastly powerful, but they are few. Even they can't oversee all of the lands. This is why they rely upon their mortal agents, the Arbiters, to guard the land's people from the more day-to-day dangers they face. Arbiters range over the land, rooting out bandits, unruly monsters, and crooked officials; their word is law. But one Arbiter uncovers the deepening corruption pervading her own order, and it falls to her to halt the spread of a threat as dire as the brutal beast of yore. Strongly influenced by games such as Final Fantasy Tactics (original and Advance versions) and Tactics Ogre, this tactical RPG stands on its own as a worthy successor of those classics, bringing a slew of improvements and additions to the tactics genre.",

DOWNLOAD AIRPLANES Over 100,000 airplanes are available to download for free from SimplePlanes.com Find anything from old WW2 bombers to next generation fighters to sci-fi spacecrafts. You can upload your own airplanes and rise through the ranks from a bronze builder to a gold level builder. LOOKING FOR VR? Are you looking for the new SimplePlanes VR ? After you get to the bottom of this page, you can check out the list showing a quick comparison between SimplePlanes and SimplePlanes VR. DYNAMIC FLIGHT MODEL Flight simulation at its finest. Every little decision you make while designing will impact how you fly it. Weight distribution, thrust, lift, and drag are all calculated continuously while flying. Parts can break off in a spectacular fashion while you're flying due to over-stress or by impacting something. The fun won't stop there though. You can keep on flying even with a missing wing if you've got the skills. CHALLENGES Climb in to the cockpit of one of your craft and see how you fare piloting it in the challenges. The challenges will keep you entertained for hours. Land on aircraft carriers, escort bombers, dodge surface-to-air missiles, race through courses, and so much more. SANDBOX Use all available parts to build airplanes with no restrictions. The sky is the limit. Literally. MODDING Modding is fully supported so you can build your own parts and environments. Download our Unity package which includes specially designed tools to aid in designing and building mods which you can then share with your friends and the community.

Both games have access to the same crafts* SimplePlanes includes an aircraft builder, SimplePlanes VR does not. Except for those which require building; all challenges, islands, locations, aircraft, etc. are available in both games. Buying both of them on Steam will automatically enable VR in SimplePlanes.

In this alternative 1960s England, conformity is key. You\u2019ll have to fight or blend in with the drug-addled inhabitants, most of whom don\u2019t take kindly to people who won\u2019t abide by their not-so-normal rules. Discover the retrofuturistic city\u2019s dark history as you play through the intertwined narratives of three quietly rebellious citizens of Wellington Wells, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, as they face their pasts, prepare for the future, and engage in activities that aren\u2019t exactly status quo in the artificially enthused society. Retrofuturistic 1960s England Set in retrofuturistic 1960s England, you will find a city ravaged by war and rebuilt by delusionally happy people. Everything appears joyful in Wellington Wells, including its roads, its people, and its omnipresent television personality: Uncle Jack! But, it\u2019s actually a world on the brink of collapse. Come unveil its dark history, and discover how and why its residents came to be so beguilingly happy. Three Interwoven Narratives Play as three flawed characters who explore their own connections to the events surrounding the rebuilding of Wellington Wells. They each have a unique storyline in which they interpret and react to the events around them in different ways. As you hide, conform, or fight back as each of them, you will encounter dark humour, a spot of hope, and even some redemption along the way. A Dystopia of Your Very Own In We Happy Few, no two playthroughs are alike. While the citizens of Wellington Wells will always want to ensure that you\u2019ve taken your Joy, the procedurally generated world will ensure that your experience with We Happy Few is different and unique. Wellington Wells is never quite like you remember it. Take Your Joy\u2026or Don\u2019t. The Choice is Yours Customize your We Happy Few experience: \u2022 Choose from a range of difficulties for new and experienced players alike, \u2022 Masochistic? Try permadeath!, \u2022 Collect recipes, scavenge items, and craft dozens of weapons, tools, and devices, \u2022 Creep, crush, or conform your way through puzzles and encounters, and \u2022 Fight with the crazy weapons you can craft, or fight with your bare hands and don\u2019t kill anyone!",

        "descripcion": "ARK: Genesis Part Two! -VLZjsXWuM Your quest for ultimate survival is now complete with the launch of ARK: Genesis Part 2! Survivors will conclude the ARK storyline while adventuring through exotic new worlds with all-new mission-based gameplay. Discover, utilize and master new creatures, new craftable items, weapons, and structures unlike anything you have seen yet! The saga is now complete, and hundreds of hours of new story-oriented ARK gameplay await you! Purchased as part of the ARK: Genesis Season Pass you gain access to two new huge story-oriented expansion packs -- Genesis Part 1 and Genesis Part 2 (new!) -- as well as a 'Noglin' Chibi cosmetic, a \u2018Shadowmane\u2019 Chibi cosmetic, a new cosmetic armor set, and an in-game, artificially intelligent companion called \u2018HLN-A\u2019 who can scan additional hidden Explorer Notes found throughout the other ARKs. Features the voiceover talent of David Tennant (Doctor Who, Good Omens) playing the villainous Sir Edmund Rockwell, and Madeleine Madden (The Wheel of Time, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Dora and the Lost City of Gold) as in-game robotic AI companion HLN-A/Helena Walker. / About the Game As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape! Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you\u2019ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies! You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style. Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner! By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK\u2019s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated. Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village! All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new 'Engrams' to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D 'Explorer Notes'. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose! Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames! The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you\u2019ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray... And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned. On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises. You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create! The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting &amp; global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) &amp; true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

A group of stalkers, for the first time, reaches the very heart of the Zone-the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant-and triggers a cataclysm on the brink of a catastrophe. An immense blast of anomalous energy transforms the Zone: the once reliable and relatively safe roads are no longer so, the landscape is wiped clean by outbursts of anomalies, and previously unknown areas appear on the Zone map. Stalkers and expeditions perish or end up isolated within the lost territories. With the anomalous activity at its maximum, the unstable Zone continues to tremor with outbursts. The transformation of the Zone map destabilizes the fragile balance of forces in the Zone. Hostilities for the new territories, artifact fields and spheres of influence flare up among groups. There are no more old enemies or friends - now, everyone watches out only for themselves. The Factions War has begun. The protagonist is a mercenary who appeared at the edge of the opposition between stalker factions, Strelok and even the Zone itself. The main character experiences the key role in the events that led to the creation of the Zone right up to the point from which the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game begins. What new challenges await stalkers within the depths of the new zone? Why do anomalous outbursts continue to rattle the Zone, and what can be done to stop them? Which faction will take the upper hand in the Factions War? These and many other questions will be answered in the official prequel - S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky.",

The follow-up game to the award-winning Source mod, Insurgency is highly competitive and unforgivingly lethal, striking a balance between one-life gameplay and prolonged action. Features Over 40 weapons with numerous attachments, no crosshair, and a focus on realistic weapon behavior including a free-aim system and intense suppression effects. 16 maps playable in day and night versions on various multiplayer and cooperative modes, ranging from environments in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. 7 multiplayer game modes supporting up to 32 players, with a focus on territorial control, destroying weapon caches and escorting high value targets. 5 cooperative game modes where you and your friends team up to complete mission-based objectives. Free content updates that include weapons, game modes, maps, and new features. Offline practice mode, playing with bots on all game modes. Squad system built upon role-based player classes, which are customizable and asymmetrical based on what team you are on. Squad-based communication system which includes 3D VOIP, allowing friendly and enemy players within proximity to hear you. Overhead map detailing objective and teammate locations. Accumulate supply to customize and upgrade your gear, affecting your weight, stamina, and movement speed.

Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or 'tug of war'. Ambush --- A high value target ('HVT') must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.",

This is an era of great leaders, from the revered to the feared. Which will you be? Marry for politics, raise your heirs, and manage your relationship with the families of your kingdom. In the fast and furious world of kings and queens, family matters. Each of the 7 kingdoms has four noble families that provide various benefits when put in charge of your cities. Manage family ties through events, actions, and marriages to keep them happy and reap additional benefits. Upset them, or make them too powerful, and you risk their ire. Maintain a strong family unit, or distract yourself with more illicit adventures. The world is full of great characters with distinct personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. Use them to forge your kingdom, defend your borders, and build ties with other leaders. Seek out and recruit famed warriors, philosophers, builders, and more. Have them tutor your children, lead your armies, and further your reign. Different personality archetypes allow your court members to perform different tasks in similar roles. Find the right combinations to take full advantage of governors, diplomats, spymasters, and even your spouse. Characters develop new personalities and traits over time, growing old, gaining experience, and finally falling ill and passing away, leaving room for the next generation. Unsettled tribes, barbarian marauders, and remnants of previous cultures are all waiting in the vast unexplored wilderness. Discover artifacts and great heroes of the past at ruins scattered across the map. Experience over 3,000 unique events inspired by history and mythology. Contact with foreign dignitaries triggers event chains, stories, and courtroom drama. Pursue ambitions and legacies related to conquest, development, faith, and more. Historically inspired scenarios, weekly challenge games, and a choice between randomly generated and handcrafted maps to explore. Lead Carthage to victory as Hannibal in the Punic Wars, hold your own against Barbarian Hordes, or compete against other players in tackling fictional scenarios. Why do things the way they've always been done? Old World brings a new take to key elements of the 4X strategy genre: Go beyond the traditional resources. Buildings are made of wood and stone, not 'industry.' Population doesn't grow off 'food' alone. Orders are a resource shared across your realm. Instead of moving every unit once per turn, each unit can be moved multiple times until fatigued or Orders are depleted. Technological advancement is not predetermined. Randomization helps keep technology trees feeling fresh with each new playthrough. Quality of life improvements, such as the ability to undo mistaken commands and nested tooltips, ensure you're always making informed decisions. Play with friends in countless multiplayer modes \u2014 from hotseat, to asynchronous, to cloud play. Mods further open up infinite options for new worlds, empires, and dynasties \u2014 inspired by our real world, and by works of fiction as well. ",

As Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker, turn Chicago into the ultimate weapon in your quest for revenge. In this Complete Edition, including the game + Season Pass, access a new game mode, weapons, outfits and missions and plays as T-Bone, the legendary hacker in a brand new campaign! About the Game All it takes is the swipe of a finger. We connect with friends. We buy the latest gadgets and gear. We find out what\u2019s happening in the world. But with that same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And it\u2019s not just people. Today, all major cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and controlled by complex operating systems. In Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central Operating System (CTOS) \u2013 and it controls almost every piece of the city\u2019s technology and holds key information on all of the city\u2019s residents. You play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy. Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family, you'll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by manipulating everything connected to the city\u2019s network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy\u2026and more. Use the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact your own style of revenge. KEY FEATURES HACK THE CITY Watch_Dogs takes place in a fully simulated living city where, using your smartphone, you have real-time control over the city\u2019s infrastructure. Trap your enemy in a 30-car pileup by manipulating the traffic lights. Stop a train, and then board it to evade the authorities. Narrowly escape capture by quickly raising a drawbridge. Anything connected to the city\u2019s CTOS can become your weapon. STREET JUSTICE Living in inner city Chicago where violence is best answered by violence, you have the skills to take the fight to the streets. Take down enemies by delivering devastating blows with your baton, or experience a shoot-out like never before with a physics simulation that rivals anything in the shooter category. Use a combination of shooting and hacking to gain advantage in any given situation. The streets are designed for you to create your own plan of attack. Overall, you will have access to more than 30 traditional weapons. HIGH OCTANE DRIVING Ubisoft Montreal has partnered with studios such as Ubisoft Reflections, the acclaimed studio behind the award-winning Driver series to bring you a game bursting with horsepower. Get behind the wheel of more than 65 vehicles, each with state of the art physics and handling, and explore the massive city while completing missions. EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL Disrupt, the all-new game engine dedicated to Watch_Dogs, uses advanced processing and graphics to deliver a stunning visual and an incredibly realistic experience. Disrupt gives you the power to affect the story, the city and the life of the population with your choices creating a ripple effect throughout the city. DYNAMIC NAVIGATION Watch_Dogs gives you the ability to not only use the city\u2019s ctOS to your advantage, but the streets as well. In real-world Chicago, cut through buildings or climb to the rooftops to catch your target.

Available on Steam for the first time, this edition is packed with new and remastered content for the ultimate zombie survival experience. Join over 10 million existing players and discover what Juggernaut Edition has to offer: The base game plus all three add-on packs released to date, including the all-new Homecoming update: \u2022 Homecoming : a full-size, fully remastered, open world version of Trumbull Valley for the core game, reintegrating the Mount Tanner and Fairfield regions to the map, and adding new sites to scavenge, along with new sights to behold. \u2022 Heartland : an massive story campaign set in a familiar town with new challenges \u2022 Daybreak Pack : a test of teamwork with siege-style, 'survive the horde' gameplay \u2022 Independence Pack : a celebration of history that blows up zombies... with fireworks!

About the Game State of Decay 2 is an open-world survival-fantasy game set just after the zombie apocalypse. Your small community of survivors seeks to rebuild a corner of civilization, and you get to make all the decisions about how that happens. You decide who to recruit to your team, where to settle your community, how to fortify and upgrade your base, and when it\u2019s time to move to greener pastures. You select which survivor to bring along on a scavenging run for the food and ammo you need, and who you\u2019ll use to fight off the zombies attacking your base. You choose how you\u2019ll deal with other people who move into your town. Will you be friendly and welcoming... or will you aggressively defend your territory? Every player\u2019s experience in the sandbox is unique. Each character in your community has their own special set of skills and traits, so no two communities are ever the same. The challenges you face also vary from game to game, based on who you recruit and the decisions you make along the way. With co-op multiplayer support, you can visit your friends' communities and help them through a tough spot, bringing back rewards for your own communities later. Alternate game modes include a full 10-hour narrative campaign and a four-player zombie-slaughtering 'siege defense' mode. Undead Labs is proud to present our best-ever vision of the zombie apocalypse. Keep your eyes peeled and your weapons ready. This is one apocalypse you won't want to miss.",

        "nombre": "Gremlins, Inc.",
        "descripcion": "OFFICIAL DISCORD SERVER Gremlins, Inc. has its official Discord server, where several thousand players discuss the game, and our team shares work in progress. Use this link to join! OUR STUDIO'S NEW GAME IN STEAM EARLY ACCESS About the Game This is an intense strategy board game in a steampunk world of corrupt capitalist gremlins who compete for money, political power and prestige. Save and invest, steal and extort, arrest and get arrested \u2013 in single-player and multiplayer, with ranks and ladders, team mode and spectator mode. Featuring seasonal content updates, regular tournaments, item drops, full support of Steam Community Market \u2013 and more! HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME? Gremlins, Inc. is designed for up to 6 players, in multiplayer or in single-player mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them either to move around the playing field or to perform different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players, and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You can play until a certain score limit, or until agreed number of rounds, or for time limit. The game offers both custom and ranked sessions (with matchmaking by rating). CAN YOU PLAY IN TEAMS OR JUST WATCH? Yes, you can! In addition to custom sessions (where you define the parameters of the session and may optionally set filters for those who can join you) and password-protected private sessions (so that you and your friends can play undisturbed), the game offers team mode (2x2, 3x3, or 2x2x2) with teams of human players and/or AI bots. Gremlins, Inc. also supports a built-in spectator mode , which allows you to watch sessions of other players right from inside of the game, sharing your emotions with players and other spectators through messages and emoticons. CAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE? Certainly! When you buy this game, you get 2 products in your Steam Library: Gremlins, Inc. \u2013 the edition that is playable online in single-player and multiplayer modes, with full support of item drops and Steam Workshop; and Gremlins vs Automatons \u2013 the edition that is playable offline in single-player mode, without any connection to our server whatsoever. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION? The game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time, and single-player mode offers automatic SAVE / LOAD function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes, while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more. SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES? There are different types of cards in the game (permanent, regular, secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action, you will develop both short-term and long-term strategies for making the most out of where you are, and what you currently have in your hand. Normally, you spend half of your game time accumulating resources and building the foundation for the end-game, and the other half trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing, arresting, initiating player conflicts, and so on). The more you play, the more new strategies you will discover \u2013 especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a combination. MAKE DECISIONS, PLAN YOUR MOVES This is an intense strategy game : make decisions at every round! Plan your moves, then adjust to the actions of the other players and new cards drawn. The design of the playing field and the multiple layers of optional features (that you can turn on or off, as you wish) allow for a variety of strategies. The more you play, the more roads to victory you discover, using a combination of features based on the particular setup of the session. The game offers a diverse resource system that allows for many comeback chances even after you're robbed or arrested (or both). With score, money, votes, malice, income and bribes, the tension often remains until the very last round. The multilayer mode of the game features a system of ratings , ladders and ranked sessions : compete in a specific league, and take part in the regularly organised tournaments with over 1 000 participants. A system of anonymous masks allows everyone to compete on equal terms in a ranked session. Every season since its release in 2016, the game receives FREE content and feature updates (balancing changes, new cards, new in-game items, new music). We are committed to continue developing this product \u2013\u00a0based on player feedback! Additionally, the game offers over 10 single-player challenges plus the option to create custom single-player sessions with different settings and a different mix of AI bots. Finally, there's the team mode where victory is determined not only by strategic skill, but also by communication and coordination of each team, which is an entirely different layer of game mechanics. FACTS &amp; FIGURES 201 cards in the main deck (171 of them \u2013\u00a0unique): permanent, regular, secret and criminal, each with a hand-drawn steampunk illustration; with each Season update, we keep adding several new cards to the deck. 40 events in the Misfortune deck : these are the special events triggered at certain moments in the game, and may affect the current standing of all players to a significant degree, especially when used on a specific opponent. 6 special Chaos Cards : this is an optional set of cards available to every player in the game; turn them on or off to change the dynamics of the session. 12 sets of Character Abilities : another optional feature that brings to the game special game mechanics unique to each character type; playing with these makes different competing strategies even more pronounced. 11 original locations : the Office, the Plant, the Dump, the Marketplace, the Inferno, the Jail, the Casino, the Court, the Treasure, the Bank and the Astral Plane; and 7 original spot types : Risk, Gamble, Police, Income, Bribe, Misfortune and Tribune. 2 distinctly different playing fields : The Clockwork Town and The Clockwork Colony, each offering strategic challenges of their own. Finally, the game took us three years to develop from concept to full release, and we're still committed to continue supporting the community through development of new content. There are currently over 150 000 players of Gremlins, Inc. on Steam from all over the world, including USA, Russia, China, Japan, UK and France. Collectively, players already launched several millions game sessions! FINALLY, WHO ARE THE GREMLINS? You think that\u2019s just a pocket watch in your hand, a watch that\u2019s a bit late because you keep forgetting to wind it up? No, no and no \u2013 you couldn\u2019t be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank, its own casino\u2026 and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or a telescope malfunctions, then it\u2019s probably due to gremlins who took up a residence there. More than anything in life, gremlins value money , political power and prestige : prestige that one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project. Aside from working on their own projects, gremlins mostly spend their time preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate, as well through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them. A DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE) We felt it important to note that Gremlins, Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also, this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs; in every session the game offers the same deck to every player, and everyone's chances are equal. OUR DLC POLICY We released Gremlins, Inc. on Steam in Early Access at the end of 2015. Since then, we released over 100 game updates as we continue to add more content and more features as well as improve the overall player experience. This is what we typically add to the game with the regular free updates of the game: * new features and new mechanics * new cards and new Misfortunes * new music tracks and new game themes (for special occasions such as Lunar New Year) These seasonal updates are available to every owner of the game for FREE, regardless of DLC ownership. And this is what we release as paid DLC: * new character portraits and player tokens * new music tracks and new game themes * new trails, frames and emoticons * new single-player content If you enjoy Gremlins, Inc., you can support our development efforts by purchasing its DLC. However, there is absolutely no pressure to own any of the extra content in order to play the game or compete in the tournaments. STEAM COMMUNITY MARKET, CRAFTING AND ITEM STORE Gremlins, Inc. features in-game items and fully supports Steam Community Market . While playing the game, certain actions will trigger random chest drops with items of varying rarity: it could be a new emoticon, a new profile background, a new music track, or one of the dozens of other cosmetic items. These items are FREE, yours to use or trade on Steam Community Market . We, the developer, do not engage in the direct sales of any drop items; only players can trade them. The game also supports crafting : once you find a blueprint of a specific item, you can create as many such items as you wish, as long as you have the required number of charges (you get charges when you convert other in-game items that you do not want, or have multiple copies of). Finally, the game has its own Steam Item Store where we sell a very small number of unique items that influence the item meta-game (but they have no effect on the game mechanics). ONLINE &amp; OFFLINE VERSIONS Gremlins, Inc. was designed as a digital board game with the multiplayer mode at its heart. However, this is not to say that we don't like single-player \u2013\u00a0we do, and there's a separate section with the single-player challenges as well as the mode where you can create any custom single-player session that you like! One of the products that you receive with this game, Gremlins, Inc. , features both single-player and multiplayer modes, and requires that your game client is connected to both Steam and the game's server at all times \u2013\u00a0in order to support item drops, Steam Community Market and Steam Workshop. The other product that is included with the game, Gremlins vs Automatons , features single-player mode and is designed specifically to be played offline.",

About the Game Shadow Warrior 2 is the stunning evolution of Flying Wild Hog\u2019s offbeat first-person shooter following the further misadventures of former corporate shogun Lo Wang. Now surviving as a reclusive mercenary on the edge of a corrupted world, the formidable warrior must again wield a devastating combination of guns, blades, magic and wit to strike down the demonic legions overwhelming the world. Battle alongside allies online in four-player co-op or go it alone in spectacular procedurally-generated landscapes to complete daring missions and collect powerful new weapons, armor, and arcane relics of legend. STORY Five years have passed since Lo Wang shattered the alliance between his deceitful former boss and the ancient gods of the shadow realm. Despite noble intentions, Lo Wang\u2019s efforts to annihilate the darkness corrupted the world, creating a strange and savage new order where humans and demons live side by side. The once feared warrior now lives in the shifting wildlands outside the reach of his enemies and the neon glow of Zilla\u2019s cybernetic metropolis, scratching out a meager existence as a hired sword for the local Yakuza clans. When a simple mission goes wrong, Lo Wang is drawn into a volatile conflict between a brilliant young scientist, his nemesis Orochi Zilla, and the demonic forces that have become unsettled in our world. The sharp-tongued hero must once again wield lethal blades, staggering firepower, and archaic magic to purge the world of evil. FEATURES Blades and Bullets: Lo Wang delivers his own brand full throttle brutality with an expanded array of over 70 lethal blades and explosive firearms to overcome the demonic opposition. Become a whirlwind of steel and blood with razor sharp katana, short swords, crescent blades, and hand claws or unleash a hellish symphony of ornate firearms to decimate your enemies. Four Player Co-Op: Battle through the expansive campaign alone or team up as a four-player typhoon of destruction online in campaign co-op mode. Tackle challenging primary missions or thrilling side quests while maintaining your own ninja style with customizable armor, items, and valuable loot from your triumphs. Procedural Environments: The breach between the human and demon realms created an interdimensional hernia resulting in constant shifts to the world of Shadow Warrior 2. Procedurally generated landscapes and paths bring new twists and turns to once familiar terrain and routine missions. Brutal Damage System: Choose your weapon based on the situation at hand and then dismantle everything that stands in your path with an advanced gore system. Use precision blade strikes to separate limbs and heads or switch to heavy ordinance and blow a hole right through colossal beasts. Custom Upgrade System: Upgrade weapons in your arsenal with up to three stones at once to improve performance or augment them with devastating elemental effects. Collect karma, amulets, and armor to enhance Lo Wang\u2019s power and shift his death-dealing artistry into overdrive. Shadow Warrior Series The Shadow Warrior series started back in the 90s with Shadow Warrior Classic that was remastered and released on Steam by Devolver Digital and 3D Realms as Shadow Warrior Classic Redux. Then in 2013, Flying Wild Hog and Devolver Digital released the bold reimagining of the legend of Lo Wang with the modern classic Shadow Warrior. / / / ",

It\u2019s a casual and chill sandbox experience for players of all ages who want to care for their very own virtual pets in a surprising, unique, and stress-free environment. The dogs start out relatively normal, but mutate and behave in surprising ways as the game progresses and their evolutionary lines advance. Dogs have highly variable bodies controlled by a simulated genetics system. As they age, they periodically enter a pupal state and physically mutate. The foods they eat fill their guts with different flora, just like in the gif above. These flora influence the dogs' mutations, letting you craft and mold them to fit your own idea of canine (im)perfection! Dogs need a place to call home, and it\u2019s up to you to create an appealing habitat to help them thrive. As you play, you'll gain access to more and more objects and decorations. String together rooms and decorate them however you\u2019d like. Give your dogs a relaxing place to sleep, set up an maze, or even cultivate a garden. There are no built-in goals, so you can prioritize whatever you like the most! The dogs in this game are physically simulated, which adds a layer of uniqueness to almost every action they take. Two dogs with separate body structures will experience the world in different ways. They also have unique personality traits that influence the types of behaviors they tend to run and govern how they interact with other dogs and objects. Wobbledogs is meant to be enjoyable simply to passively observe, but it\u2019s also rewarding to interact with the dogs directly, whether that\u2019s petting them to relieve some stress, tossing a pup around to watch it tumble through the pen, or helping your canine companion get free after it wriggled itself into a particularly tight space. These dogs try their best, but sometimes they need a bit of extra help! ",

        "descripcion": "Roadmap DISCORD CHECK OUR FRIENDS' GAMES / About the Game You play the role of captain Ashley S. Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite scientist/commando inside a powerful Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls 'Mr. Riggs', can withstand the harshest environmental conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances. BASE BUILDING Your task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants and research facilities to complete this mission. DEFENSE Your presence on this planet will not go unnoticed. As you build up your industry and disrupt the natural order, the world will start seeing you as a threat. Build up your defenses. Construct walls, barriers and defense towers as the attacks get stronger with every passing day. You will face thousands of hostile creatures trying to eliminate your presence. EXPLORATION Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using rift technology. CAMPAIGN Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. You\u2019re the only human there, after all. SURVIVAL Your mission is to survive a set amount of time, fighting off increasingly difficult waves of enemy creatures. Each mission in the game is randomized, offering nearly endless replayability. SANDBOX If intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game \u2013 including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions. CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY The Riftbreaker\u2122\u2019s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings. There are also multiple difficulty presets to suit the needs of both hardcore strategy players as well as those that want a laid-back base-building experience. COMMUNITY DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT If you've read everything and arrived all the way down here, then you might be interested in helping us shape the game. Please come and talk to us on the forums, our official Discord server or through any other of our social media. We'll be sharing inside info about our development progress, and we'd love to hear your feedback. Please come and help us make Riftbreaker the game You want to play!",

        "descripcion": "Total War Academy About the Game DEFEND YOUR WORLD. DESTROY THEIRS. Total War: WARHAMMER II is a strategy game of titanic proportions. Choose from four unique, varied factions and wage war your way \u2013 mounting a campaign of conquest to save or destroy a vast and vivid fantasy world. This is a game of two halves \u2013 one a turn-based open-world campaign, and the other intense, tactical real-time battles across the fantastical landscapes of the New World. Play how you choose \u2013 delve into a deep engrossing campaign, experience unlimited replayability and challenge the world in multiplayer with a custom army of your favourite units. Total War: WARHAMMER II offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and no two games are the same. World-Spanning Conquest Engage in statecraft, diplomacy, exploration and build your empire, turn by turn. Capture, build and manage teeming settlements and recruit vast armies. Level up Legendary Lords and Heroes and arm them with mythical weapons and armour. Negotiate alliances or declare Total War to subjugate any that stand between you and your goal. Epic Real-Time Battles Command thousands-strong legions of soldiers in intense tactical battles. Send forth ferocious, twisted monsters, fire-breathing dragons and harness powerful magic. Utilise military strategies, lay ambushes, or use brute force to turn the tide of combat and lead your forces to victory. The second in a trilogy and sequel to the award-winning Total War: WARHAMMER, Total War: WARHAMMER II brings players a breath-taking new narrative campaign, set across the vast continents of Lustria, Ulthuan, Naggaroth and the Southlands. The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike any other Total War title to date. Playing as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races. Each Legendary Lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics, narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, Lores of Magic, legendary characters, and staggering new battlefield army abilities. Shortly after launch, owners of both the original game and Total War\u2122 WARHAMMER II will gain access to the colossal third campaign. Exploring a single open-world epic map covering the Old World and the New World, players may embark on monumental campaigns as any owned Race from both titles. Conquer the world, together Each of the Races in Total War\u2122 WARHAMMER II will be playable in single and multiplayer campaign, plus custom and multiplayer battles. As the two Legendary Lords for each race all have their own unique campaign start positions, you\u2019ll be able to play a 2-player co-op campaign as the same race. If you own both parts 1 and 2, you\u2019ll be able to play in multiplayer as any of the races you own. The World of Total War: WARHAMMER II Millennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin. Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent. Atop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail. The Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex \u2013 and great opportunity in its demise. Meanwhile the Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, stir in their foetid subterranean tunnels. There they multiply unchecked and look hungrily towards the surface, their motives obscured. The time for revelation is nigh\u2026 Four races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill. ",

Setting Once every decade, elder dragons trek across the sea to travel to the land known as the New World in a migration referred to as the Elder Crossing. To get to the bottom of this mysterious phenomenon, the Guild has formed the Research Commission, dispatching them in large fleets to the New World. As the Commission sends its Fifth Fleet in pursuit of the colossal elder dragon, Zorah Magdaros, one hunter is about to embark on a journey grander than anything they could have ever imagined. ECOSYSTEM A World That Breathes Life There are various locations teeming with wildlife. Expeditions into these locales are bound to turn up interesting discoveries. HUNTING A Diverse Arsenal, and an Indispensable Partner Your equipment will give you the power to need to carve out a place for yourself in the New World. The Hunter's Arsenal There are fourteen different weapons at the hunter's disposal, each with its own unique characteristics and attacks. Many hunters acquire proficiency in multiple types, while others prefer to attain mastery of one. Scoutflies Monster tracks, such as footprints and gashes, dot each locale. Your Scoutflies will remember the scent of a monster and guide you to other nearby tracks. And as you gather more tracks, the Scoutflies will give you even more information. Slinger The Slinger is an indispensable tool for a hunter, allowing you to arm yourself with stones and nuts that can be gathered from each locale. From diversion tactics to creating shortcuts, the Slinger has a variety of uses, and allows you to hunt in new and interesting ways. Specialized Tools Specialized tools activate powerful effects for a limited amount of time, and up to two can be equipped at a time. Simple to use, they can be selected and activated just like any other item you take out on a hunt. Palicoes Palicoes are hunters' reliable comrades out in the field, specialized in a variety of offensive, defensive, and restorative support abilities. The hunter's Palico joins the Fifth Fleet with pride, as much a bona fide member of the Commission as any other hunter. ",

        "descripcion": "UPCOMING GAMES / About the Game IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY Children of Morta is an action RPG with a rogue-lite approach to character development, where you don\u2019t play a single character - but a whole, extraordinary family of heroes. Hack\u2019n\u2019slash through hordes of enemies in procedurally generated dungeons, caves and lands and lead the family of Bergsons, with all their flaws and virtues, against the forthcoming Corruption. FEATURES: ONLINE CO-OP is live now in the game giving you the possibility to play with a long-distanced friend! Available both in Story and Family Trials modes, the Online Co-op gives you a chance to team up and battle Corruption side by side. Local Co-op is also available! GAMEPLAY Gameplay-wise it's a unique mix of action-adventure RPG, rogue-lite and hack and slash game. By leveling up, you develop not only individual characters but also the entire family. There is no permadeath and you can change family members between the dungeon runs. STORY The story takes place in a distant land but copes with themes and emotions common to all of us: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss... and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for. Ultimately, it's about a family of heroes standing against the encroaching darkness. DUNGEON CRAWLING All the dungeons in the game are procedurally generated, which means their layout is different with each adventure. There can be from two to four levels of each dungeon, with a unique boss fight at the end. You can always get back to the previous dungeons to get extra XP or finish all the side quests. CHARACTERS &amp; SKILLS Ranged attacks, magic spells, blocks, stuns, healing, evasions and passive skills - it's all there for you to discover, unlock and upgrade. You can choose from seven different family members, each one having unique skill sets. The father, John - a protective warrior with a sword and shield. The elder daughter Linda - a precise archer. Kevin, a quiet fighter equipped with deadly daggers. Lucy - a lively and bold fire mage. Mark - a mindful martial arts fighter. Joey - who smashes his enemies with a sledgehammer. And the latest addition to the family - Apan, a mighty healer and a firm defender in one. ART STYLE A combination of hand-painted pixel art and frame-by-frame animations partnered with modern lighting techniques come to life to create the beautifully dangerous world of Children of Morta! DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP COMPLETED The ancient Development Roadmap has come to an end. As a result the game has gained additional content including new characters, new items, new mechanics and more! The final point - Fellowship Sanctuary - has been reached, giving you a free update with Online Co-op for two players. The Online Co-op is available in all game modes (Story and Family Trials) and like the local co-op, it offers numerous playstyles, since every Children of Morta warrior has a unique fight style.

Featuring a dual story, begin your adventure with either Yuito Sumeragi, an energetic recruit from a prestigious political family or Kasane Randall, the mysterious scout whose power and skill has gained great notoriety among the OSF.

In short words - that means you can now experience lots of never-seen-before playthroughs and struggle with new challenges. It has been a long road. However, all stories must come to an end. This War of Mine has been giving you a thrilling experience of living through the war as a civilian for five years since its release. Numerous updates and expansions have broadened the experience and filled it with more shades and tonalities of hard civilian existence during wartime. Now, honoring the 5th anniversary of the original release, 11 bit studios proudly presents to you This War of Mine: Final Cut. This War of Mine: Final Cut contains all the updates and free expansions released so far and introduces not only a new scenario but also expands all scenarios with the locations known from Stories DLCs - even if you don\u2019t own those. In short words - that means you can now experience lots of never-seen-before playthroughs and struggle with new challenges.

Go to Properties -&gt; Betas. From the drop-down list, choose vanilla - This War of Mine: Original Release 1.0 Close the window and update the game This War of Mine: Final Cut marks an end of an era for 11 bit studios, so let\u2019s hear what the art director Przemyslaw Marszal, the person who created the unique style of This War of Mine, has to say: \u201cWe wanted to put the last touch to this phenomenon. The phenomenon, which made us who we are today as a team, equally in terms of creative fearlessness and business direction, and helped us pave our further way. Fantastic support from the gaming community was a huge part of that success, so it was without any doubt that this update must be free. We think of the Final Cut as a closing episode to the one-of-a-kind series This War of Mine has been. It will remain precious to our hearts and I don\u2019t know what ideas the future will bring but Final Cut is final by no means. The creative minds in our studio, who were with the game up to this point, started to pursue new challenges. So we're excited about what's coming.\u201d ABOUT THIS WAR OF MINE: In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better. This War of Mine - main features: Inspired by real-life events Control your survivors and manage your shelter Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves \u2013 anything that helps you survive Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme The universe of This War of Mine has been expanded by following DLCs: The Little Ones - explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective - that of a child. This War of Mine: Anniversary Edition - this free DLC, created especially for the 2nd Anniversary of the game, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly - a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same \u2013 how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about? This War of Mine: Stories DLCs: Episode 1: The Father's Promise \u2013 a heartbreaking tale of loss and hope in a war-torn city Episode 2: The Last Broadcast \u2013 where, as a radio operator, you are going to face moral dilemmas and decide, whether there is a price too high for the truth Episode 3: Fading Embers \u2013 portrays a story of Anja living in a warzone and carrying a heavy burden as she has to answer to herself what is more important - survival of human legacy or the survival of a man\u2026 ",

        "nombre": "Rogue Legacy 2",
        "descripcion": "Rogue Legacy is back! But now it's got a 2 on the end of it! Rogue Legacy 2 is a genealogical rogue-LITE. That means it has all the trappings of a typical rogue-like (randomized runs, changing characters, and more), but with persistent upgrades, and persistent dead heirs. In this game, your legacy defines you. Spend your parents\u2019 inheritance and grow the family manor to give your children a better fighting chance. Each child is unique, with their own traits and abilities. Your daughter could be a Ranger. She could also be vegan. It\u2019s a new experience every time. Rogue Legacy 2 also lets you play how you want to. Go hard and fast, and dive deeper into the depths of a randomly-generated world. Or take it slow and steady and build your character up until you\u2019re ready for greater challenges. Every Adventure is Unique New monsters, new traps, and new layouts await you every time you enter the Kingdom. This is a world where improvisation, and not memorization is the key to success. Wildly New Classes No two classes play the same. Hide atop Ivy Canopies as the Ranger, and rain poisoned arrows down onto your foes. Take to the skies as a Dragon Lancer and fly across the skies striking foes at massive speeds. Or sing and dance through your enemies, as the joyous bard, leaving only a trail of bodies behind you. Rogue Legacy 2 supports 15 new classes, with 15 distinct styles of play. Brand New Style We\u2019re taking a whole new artistic approach to Rogue Legacy 2. The sequel features 2.5D stylings, with 3D characters against hand-drawn backdrops. The art uses heavy shading and all animations are done using stepping techniques to keep the familiar RL look and feel. Revamped Biome Generation We went all-out with biome generation to make each area in RL2 feel completely new. Each biome adopts different \u201cbuild strategies\u201d to create completely unique yet-still-randomly-generated regions. True Metroidvania To really push the metroidvania flair, RL2 introduces heirlooms: special items that permanently give your heroes new abilities that fully reveal the world\u2019s secrets. These are not basic lock-in-key abilities, but powers that fundamentally change how you play. And heirlooms are not simply handed to you. You must prove your worth, provided you can find them. Traits 2.0 Though fun the first time, the traits in RL1 often wore their welcome later in the game. We\u2019ve now added gold modifiers to entice players to take on new challenges. The more debilitating the trait is (in-game), the bigger the reward. This makes choosing your heirs a meaningful decision every time. Relics and Resolve One of the most exciting new features to Rogue Legacy 2 is the ability to pick up Relics, which are unique items that change how your run is played. Gain stat modifiers, complete special challenges, and even gain brand new abilities as you traverse the kingdom. But be careful, the more Relics you obtain the more your resolve is shaken, and all Relics are lost if your hero perishes. Improved Accessibility We\u2019ve taken accessibility to the next level with the introduction of House Rules. Toggle contact damage, tweak global damage and health, and even give yourself flight for difficult platform sections. You have complete control over how you want to play the game. We\u2019ve also introduced new mechanics such as Off-shore Banking to give struggling players more ways to succeed. A Rich Narrative Not only is the lore to the world of Rogue Legacy greatly expanded in the sequel, but it runs deep. New lore awaits you all the multiple NG\u2019s in. Beating the game once is only the beginning. Learn about the inevitable collapse of a once thriving kingdom, and discover the dark secrets of the ones responsible. And connect and build relationships with the characters you meet along the way. New Game+ for Days Your journey has only begun after beating the final boss in RL2. There is a ton more to explore and discover on multiple playthroughs. You must choose how the game gets harder, from unique biome hazards, to special boss fights. The experience keeps changing for near infinite replayability. More of Everything Of course we\u2019re also adding more of everything people loved from the original Rogue Legacy. More traits, more spells, more classes, more biomes, more enemies, more equipment, more rooms, more story. More secrets ... Just more everything. Clownanthropy. Holy smokes! Punching clowns!

Da Nang - in another \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenario, the NLF guerillas breach the defenses of the huge Da Nang Air Base, with the USMC defenders trying to hold them back.

This is now the 13th content update for you, bringing: 3 New Maps The last 2 remastered maps brought forward from RO2/RS1: Apache Snow (remastered from \u201cWinterwald\u201d) - ARVN forces fighting their way steadily up a heavily-wooded hill, clearing NLF positions as they go. Demilitarized Zone (remastered from \u201cMamayev\u201d) - main-force North Vietnamese PAVN troops assaulting dug-in ARVN units, across a burned-out and blasted hill in the DMZ area. The third map is a favorite community map made official: Saigon - PAVN forces fighting their way through Saigon, past the US Embassy, the cathedral and on to the Presidential palace, as ARVN troops try to hold them off. New Weapons This update brings in some new weapons for the Northern forces: RP-46 light machine gun - a modernized variant of the classic DP-28, also license-built in China and North Korea, with stocks being supplied to the North Vietnamese MAS-49 - stocks of this semi-automatic rifle were left behind by the French and were used by the Northern forces in standard, sniper and rifle-grenade formats Molotov cocktail - the classic homemade weapon of guerilla forces the world over Many other changes and fixes, including: Balance pass on many maps Radiomen can now spawn on their commander Leaning system overhauled Individual Class Customization Campaign Role and Weapon Balance changes Helicopter Aiming decoupled from the vehicle rotation And hundreds of bug fixes! Update 12 - Rearmed and Remastered With this, the 12th free content update in 18 months, we are bringing you a long list of performance improvements, audio occlusion, new weapons for the North Vietnamese forces, new maps, new heads - and a specific community request. New weapons for the North Vietnamese: MP40 - the famous German sub-machine gun from WW2, issued to the NLF from Soviet stockpiles of captured weapons. 200-round belt for the RPD - this new variant will be selectable from the Role Select menu. Deployable DShK - players on the North Vietnamese team will be able to pick up a DShK 12.7mm heavy machine-gun from a resupply point, carry it to a new location and deploy it wherever they need it. Fougasse mine - a new trap for the Northern Sappers to use, this is basically a large improvised explosive device, detonated unwary Southern players standing on a pressure plate New weapon for the Southern forces: The M2 Browning .50-caliber heavy machine gun will appear as a static support weapon in the new maps. Performance improvements: A considerable number of performance improvements have been implemented for this update, to player characters, particle effects, level optimizations, changes to the Instanced Rendering system, a new set of weapon LODs and a set of changes to textures, with an emphasis on improving how texture streaming is handled. New maps: This update marks the release of two \u2018remasters\u2019 of fan-favourite Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm maps, taking them from their original settings and into the war-torn jungles of Vietnam: Mekong (remastered from 'Hanto') - the NLF, fighting their way through the jungle to a US Marine Corps base. Dong Ha (remastered from 'Guadalcanal') - a night-time assault by the NLF, through the jungle, against the outskirts of an airbase defended by the US Army. Audio Occlusion: We have implemented a new system where gunshots and other ingame sounds are appropriately affected by their environment. This does not apply to all sounds in the game, but will affect any sound loud enough to be heard through walls, and be muffled/occluded by obstacles such as buildings or terrain. 6 new heads: For a little more variety, we are providing you with 3 new heads for the North Vietnamese, plus 3 for the US Army and Marine Corps. The 3 US heads represent the diverse ethnicity of the US forces of the period, with one being Hispanic, one Native American and one Asian. And last, but by no means least, cinematics for the conclusion of a campaign! After we released the Multiplayer Campaign update, players requested suitable cinematic sequences for the end of a Campaign. You spoke, we listened, we agreed - so here they are! Multiplayer Campaign Content Update With this update, we are bringing back the much-loved Multiplayer Campaign Mode from previous games, adapted to the Vietnam War. The key features: Full 64-player Campaign Mode Play as the Northern or Southern forces battling for control region by region Fight from 1965 through 1975, with the forces and weapons available varying with the year Help select the region to compete for, the army to use and the actual map to fight over The Northern forces can choose to make strategic use of the Ho Chi Minh Trail option to bring stronger PAVN forces to bear The Southern forces can respond with carefully-timed use of the Search and Destroy option to cause the maximum damage to the enemy Fight over familiar maps with different armies, different Commander abilities and weapons, different attackers and defenders Help decide the fate of the war in Vietnam! In addition, one more map from the RISING STORM 2: VIETNAM $40,000 Modding Contest makes it to an official release: Highway 14 - this massive map features the US Army fighting their way along a highway through difficult terrain, clearing objective after objective, with the NLF guerrillas trying to stop them. As always, there are a large number of smaller updates, bug fixes and enhancements, this time including: Tripwire traps and tunnel spawns can be placed in more surface types, making them more useful in urban environments - it just takes longer to dig in concrete! The ARVN now get their own variant of ERDL camoflage, plus a tiger stripe boonie, while the US get Mitchell Cloud camo And, as a special request for a mapper, we have created a single sound effect for a clap of thunder, instead of the existing looping one. We hope you enjoy using it! And finally, 3 other maps are out of beta, featuring updates driven by feedback from the players: Operation Forrest - the Territories version of this official map Firebase Georgina Border Watch ARVN Content Update This update adds the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) as a full playable faction in the game.

Visibility is limited under the cover of darkness with occasional flares lighting up the battlefield.

About the Game Rising Storm 2: Vietnam is the next in the series that has twice been PC Gamer\u2019s \u2018Multiplayer Game of the Year\u2019 , bringing the franchise into the era of automatic rifles, man-portable grenade launchers and more modern weapons systems. Still with the authentic look and feel and realistic weapon handling that the series is known for. Continuing the Tripwire tradition of providing strong support for games post-launch, Vietnam has already been updated multiple times, providing the player with: 64-player battles 6 different armies to play, each with their own weapons and abilities: United States Army and Marine Corps North Vietnamese Army (PAVN) and National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) Australian Army Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Over 50 weapons, covering everything from rifles and pistols to flamethrowers and rocket launchers 4 flyable helicopters - Huey, Cobra, Loach and Bushranger Asymmetric warfare - VC traps and tunnels vs. US napalm and choppers More than 20 maps 3 distinct game-modes Proximity VOIP And hundreds of character customization options. Rising Storm 2: Vietnam offers intense action for up to 64 players in battles between the forces of South Vietnam (the US and their Allies) and those of the North - the regular, main-force units of North Vietnamese Army, plus the guerilla fighters of the National Liberation Front (or Viet Cong). SOUTHERN FORCES - US, Australian and ARVN The Southern forces have firepower and mobility on their side, with each army having its own unique supporting arms: US Army/Marine Corps - airburst artillery, the Spooky gunship and napalm strikes Australian Army - Pair of Canberra bombers and heavy artillery ARVN - medium mortar barrage and napalm strikes from older A-1 Skyraiders For mobility, they have access to full helicopter support: UH-1 \u201cHuey\u201d: provides rapid transport for a squad across the map OH-6 \u201cLoach\u201d: acts as both a spotter and airborne command post, as well as a fast gunship, with its miniguns AH-1G \u201cCobra\u201d: heavily-armed gunship with massive firepower for a pilot and weapons officer Australian \u201cBushranger\u201d: a Huey, with dual M60 machine guns, minigun and rockets Tactically, the Southern squad leaders become important - so long as the squad leader is alive and in a smart location, the rest of his squad can spawn in on his location. So keep your squad leaders alive at critical moments! As for weapons, the Southern forces had a wide range of the best weaponry of Western nations, ranging from older, WWII-era leftovers, through to the latest technology of the time: M1 Garand, M2 Carbine, M3 \u201cgrease gun\u201d, BAR and M1919 .30-cal LMG M14 Battle Rifle, M40 and XM21 sniper rifles M60 LMG and M16 automatic rifle For heavier support - the M79 grenade launcher and M9A1-7 flamethrower Explosives - M61 frag grenade, M8 smoke, C4 explosives and M18 Claymore NORTHERN FORCES - NVA and VC The Northern forces offer a broader mix , with the People\u2019s Army of Vietnam (PAVN - or NVA) as the regular, disciplined and better-equipped main fighting force, in comparison to the National Liberation Front (NLF) guerrilla fighters, equipped with whatever weaponry was passed down the chain to them from Russia and China - known as the Viet Cong. For supporting weapons each has: PAVN/NVA - heavy artillery, surface-to-air missile defenses and rapid reinforcement from the Ho Chi Minh trail NLF/VC - a mix of ordnances (mortars, rockets, white phosphorous) used in a heavy barrage To compete with the Southern forces\u2019 mobility, the Northern forces have their own mobility - and stealth: NVA and VC squad leaders can place spawn tunnels widely across the maps, allowing themselves and their squads to spawn much closer to the action - or even behind the lines Given their \u201chome field advantage\u201d, any NVA or VC crouching or prone in cover can\u2019t be spotted by Southern helicopters or aircraft SA-2 Missiles - the quick way to counter Southern air assets is by calling on surface-to-air missiles, if the commander can time it right \u201cHo Chi Minh Trail\u201d ability - the NVA/VC commander can activate this ability to accelerate his team\u2019s spawning rate, when times get desperate \u201cAmbush Spawn\u201d ability - the NVA/VC commander can also cause anyone on his team who is waiting, to spawn on his location for potentially devastating ambushes. The weaponry for the Northern forces is wide-ranging - the PAVN well-equipped with modern weapons delivered from Russia and China, while the VC have to work with a wide variety of weapons: AK-47 and Type 56 Assault rifles Russian SKS-45 and US M1 Carbines and Mosin Nagant 91/30 rifle MN 91/30 and SVD sniper rifles PPSh-41 and French MAT-49 SMGs IZh-58 double-barrelled shotgun DP-28 and RPD LMGs RPG-7 rocket launcher MD-82 toe-popper mines, Tripwires and Punji traps ",

        "nombre": "RimWorld",
        "descripcion": "RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune. You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world. Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions. Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more. Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses. Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others. Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines. Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials. Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts. Trade with passing ships and caravans. Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony. Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires. Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery. Discover a new generated world each time you play. Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop. Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor. RimWorld is a story generator. It\u2019s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the \u201crandom\u201d events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. Your colonists are not professional settlers \u2013 they\u2019re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You\u2019ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew. Each person\u2019s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill \u2013 but he does that very well. Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound. The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster. You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms. People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down. Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous. You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs. And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active mod community . Read more at . (All non-English translations are made by fans.)",

Dive Into a Vast Underwater World You have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica's oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful. Scavenge, Craft, and Survive After crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items. Construct Underwater Habitats Build bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean. Unravel the Mystery What happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive? Disrupt the Food Chain The ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators. Handle the Pressure Build a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more. Fear the Night As the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see. Dive Below the Ocean Floor Cave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.

Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named \"Best PC Game Ever\" by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide. NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him. The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source&reg;, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in: Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial \"muscles,\" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence. Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy. Graphics: Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story&reg; and Monster's, Inc.&reg;, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game. AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand. ",

Carve your way through terrifying dungeons, dreadful forests and dark caves filled with horrific monsters to reap your rewards\u2026 or die trying. Sell your sword to anyone who can afford it, may they be city officials or corrupt cultists. You are paid to get results and not ask questions. Where will you draw the line? Gloomhaven is a tactical RPG and a digital adaptation of the ultimate strategy board game by Isaac Childres (the highest-rated board game of all time on\u00a0 ). Set in a unique medieval dark fantasy universe, Gloomhaven rewards strategic planning and problem solving.\u00a0 Face this dark world alone or in online co-op for up to 4 players! Explore the world in a band of 2 to 4 mercenaries. Each of the 17 unique characters comes with their own skills and more than 1,000 different abilities to master! Prepare your deck of ability cards before setting out to explore the dark caves and dreadful forest of Gloomhaven through quests and events. Once inside a dungeon, engage in tactical turn-based combat by selecting two cards for each mercenary on every turn. You can only use the top half of one and the bottom half of another, so plan accordingly! Move up your hired blades on the hex grid terrain to take advantage of the dungeon\u2019s environment. Set up deadly combos and unleash devastating powers but be wary of the cost. Cards are a resource as scarce and crucial as your life points, so watch out for exhaustion. Every choice has life or death consequences. Hone your abilities during the game with enhancements and perks, while your power increases with level ups and new equipment. You need every advantage you can to survive here. So, gear up your band of mercenaries, chase powerful artifacts, buy the favor of the Great Oak, and never let your guard down. Adapted from the original Gloomhaven Board Game, this branching campaign of 95 story missions pits your greed against your morality. Many powerful opponents are vying for control over the city of Gloomhaven while others are looking for ancient crypts and forgotten artefacts. You could always side with the inhabitants, but it may not pay well\u2026 Whatever your path may be, it will be paved with difficult choices. Created in collaboration with the community during the early access , the Guildmaster adventure has more than 160 exclusive digital missions that allow you to experience another facet of Gloomhaven with new storylines, quests, map and NPCs. Lead your guild of mercenaries in a region overrun by unspeakable things, far worse than simple bandits. Choose the best combination of mercenaries for each fight and follow their character stories in this deadly new territory.",

The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid \u2013 Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side. CRIMENET \u2013 The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician 'The Elephant', and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level \u2013 Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios \u2013 No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills \u2013 As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever \u2013 PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications \u2013 A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way \u2013 Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes or running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, each approach will provide a different experience. A Long History of Additional Content \u2013 More than 70 updates since release, including new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts. ",

        "descripcion": "RUN YOUR RESTAURANT ON WHEELS AND ADD IT TO YOUR WISHLIST / THE DESERT TOO HOT? HOW ABOUT SOME SNOW? / SOME GREAT GAMES TO HAVE A LOOK AT / / About the Game / / Gas Station Simulator is all about renovating, expanding and running a gas station along a highway in the middle of a desert. Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don\u2019t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can\u2019t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. You don\u2019t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs or even a car wash. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here. Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted. Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren\u2019t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it\u2019s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. While you can try, it most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. You can\u2019t sell what you don\u2019t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don\u2019t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel. We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it. However, if micromanaging isn\u2019t your cup of tea, we don\u2019t force you to deal with the depths of it. That being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or employees can be very rewarding both in terms of finances and fun. Key Features Renovate, run and expand a gas station in the desert. Build new services like a workshop, shop, warehouse or car wash. Try to handle everything on your own or hire employees to help out. Interesting events on top of the normal gameplay. Lots of customisation and decoration options. Lots of different customers with varying needs and expectations. Lots of management options for you to dive into. / ",

        "descripcion": "Free Demo Available Here A free-roaming squad based RPG focusing on open-ended sandbox gameplay features rather than a linear story. Be a trader, a thief, a rebel, a warlord, an adventurer, a farmer, a slave, or just food for the cannibals. Research new equipment and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh desert. Train your men up from puny victims to master warriors. Carry your wounded squad mates to safety and get them all home alive. Features Freeform gameplay in a seamless game world in the largest single-player RPG world since Daggerfall, stretching over 870 square kilometers. The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style. Custom design as many characters as you want and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too. Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre. No 'hero' characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life. You are not the chosen one. You're not great and powerful. You don't have more 'hitpoints' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it. Build a base where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Variation and possibilities of gameplay. Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself. Dynamic, ever changing world. Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won't stop moving. This is not just a 'game', you are living and surviving in a simulated world. Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive , or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. Absolutely no Level-scaling. The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don't change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won't hold your hand or help you when you're down. Realistic medical system that affects gameplay. A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A character\u2019s stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. Intelligent AI that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh environment. Independently developed with no design influences, or alterations dictated by men in gray suits who have never played a game before in their lives. Original game world. There are no fantasy-knock-off cliches. No magic. ",

As founders of a fledgling resistance, you\u2019ve continued your clandestine scientific activity\u2014performing critical research, and building invaluable tools for the few humans brave enough to defy the Combine. Every day, you learn more about your enemy, and every day you work toward finding a weakness. ABOUT GAMEPLAY IN VR: Valve\u2019s return to the Half-Life universe that started it all was built from the ground up for virtual reality. VR was built to enable the gameplay that sits at the heart of Half-Life. Immerse yourself in deep environmental interactions, puzzle solving, world exploration, and visceral combat. Lean to aim around a broken wall and under a Barnacle to make an impossible shot. Rummage through shelves to find a healing syringe and some shotgun shells. Manipulate tools to hack alien interfaces. Toss a bottle through a window to distract an enemy. Rip a Headcrab off your face and throw it out the window. COMMUNITY-BUILT ENVIRONMENTS A set of Source 2 tools for building new levels is included with the game, enabling any player to build and contribute new environments for the community to enjoy through Half-Life: Alyx's Steam Workshop . Hammer, Valve\u2019s level authoring tool, has been updated with all of the game's virtual reality gameplay tools and components.",

Wield devastating weaponry as a Frontiersman marine, or become the xenomorph as a deadly Kharaa lifeform. Strategy Meets Shooter Natural Selection 2 is a First Person Shooter and Real Time Stategy game rolled into one! Each team, alien and human, has a Commander. The Commander looks down on the battlefield and issues orders, places structures, collects resources, researches technology, and deploys abilities. Here are some gameplay examples: A human Commander could drop health packs and ammunition to a trapped marine squad, and deploy sentry guns to help them defend their position. Or an alien Commander could grow a new Hive to spread infestation throughout newly captured territory, allowing more alien eggs to spawn... Two Unique Sides Aliens players choose to evolve into one of five lifeforms: The fast, fearsome Skulk can run on walls and deliver massive damage with its jaws. Lerks fly and deploy gasses to support their teammates in battle. Gorges heal other lifeforms and build tunnels, hydra turrets, walls, and other tactical structures. Fades blink in and out of battle, picking off marines with giant scythes. Finally, the giant Onos is so massive and so tough, that even entire marine squads can't take it down. Marines wield rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, pistols, and other weapons. Cluster grenades can clear ventilation shafts of sneaky Skulks, flamethrowers make short work of alien structures and infestation, and boosts dropped by the Commander increase combat effectiveness. When attacking on foot doesn't cut it, marines can construct hulking Exosuits wielding miniguns and railguns, and equip jetpacks for high speed assaults on alien Hives. Long Term Development Natural Selection 2 receives constant updates. This year, 2019, Unknown Worlds continues to develop new features, content, and improvements. Mod Tools Come Standard Natural Selection 2 comes with all the tools we used to make the game. All game code is open source. That means you can create, and play, an endless variety of mods. Publish, share, and download mods from the Steam Workshop, and automatically download mods when you join modded games. Digital Deluxe Edition Digital Deluxe Edition includes: Official Soundtrack - 1 hour of tribal, industrial music composed by David John and Simon Chylinski Digital Art Book - 40+ pages of art by Cory Strader, including environments, creatures, weapons and more Exclusive in-game marine model - Exclusive in-game marine model - A new marine model with custom visor and armor plating Exclusive Wallpapers and Avatars - Unique views of the NS2 universe by Amanda Diaz ",

Take control of a team of deadly specialists and sneak in the shadows between dozens of enemies. Choose your approach when infiltrating mighty castles, snowy mountain monasteries or hidden forest camps. Set traps, poison your opponents or completely avoid enemy contact. The group is composed of very different personalities. Working together as a team seems impossible at first. Yet over the course of many missions, trust is won and friendships are made. The characters develop their own dynamic and each member will have to face their own personal demons. One of the leaders of this team is Hayato, an agile ninja, who clears the way through his enemies silently, with his sword and shuriken. Samurai Mugen prefers a more powerful approach and can defeat more fiends at one time, but thus also forfeiting flexibility. Aiko is a master of camouflage when she distracts enemies disguised as a Geisha. And the street child Yuki places traps and decoys enemies towards their deadly fate. The mysterious marksman Takuma however, relies on his sniper rifle and takes care of the enemies from a distance. The player has to carefully evaluate his options in order to master the challenging missions: how will the characters behave as a team? Which one is best equipped for each task? How can they best master the given missions? Come up with your own ingenious tactics to vanquish enemies and complete missions. Play as five completely different characters with their unique skill set Conquer seemingly impossible challenges where you are outnumbered ten to one Find dozens of ways to take out your opponents the way you want Jump from roof to roof and climb large buildings to attack the enemy from above Explore beautiful environments of ancient Japan in the Edo era Choose from three difficulty levels to match your skill ",

        "descripcion": "What's in the Supporter Edition? For those of you who really want to support us for developing this game, and in developing further games, we also offer the Supporter Edition. Like the Deluxe Edition, this includes both the game itself and the soundtrack. In addition, you get a digital art and lore book with a lot of background info about the game, its art and its creation, as well as our very first legendary item in the game, complete with a look of its own and a unique background story: Fangshire. About the Game Battle Brothers is a turn based tactical RPG which has you leading a mercenary company in a gritty, low-power, medieval fantasy world. You decide where to go, whom to hire or to fight, what contracts to take and how to train and equip your men in a procedurally generated open world campaign. Do you have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory? The game consists of a strategic worldmap and a tactical combat layer. On the worldmap you can freely travel in order to take contracts that earn you good coin, find places worth looting, enemies worth pursuing or towns to resupply and hire men at. This is also where you manage, level up and equip your Battle Brothers. Once you engage a hostile party the game will switch to a tactical map where the actual fighting takes place as detailed turn based combat. Manage a medieval mercenary company in a procedurally generated open world. Fight complex turn-based tactical battles with historical equipment and brutal injuries. Permadeath. All characters that die in combat will stay dead \u2013 unless they return as the undead. All characters come with their own background stories and traits. Want a stuttering ratcatcher, a greedy witch hunter or a drunkard disowned noble? Character development without a restrictive class-system. Each character gains experience through combat, can level up and acquire powerful perks. Equipment that matters. Different weapons grant unique skills \u2013 split shields with axes, stun enemies with maces, form a spearwall with spears or crush armor with a warhammer. Diverse enemy roster. All enemies have unique equipment, skills and AI behavior. A dynamic event system with atmospheric encounters and tough decisions outside of combat. Three late game crises \u2013 a war between noble houses, a greenskin invasion and an undead scourge \u2013 add a looming threat. Two full hours of orchestral soundtrack. 70 Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards. Overhype Studios is an independent game developer studio from Hamburg, Germany. We are devoted to making great games that we want to play ourselves. With Battle Brothers we strive to reflect the creativity, complexity and originality from the old days when game developers were passionate gamers, not corporate businessmen. While doing this we took a lot of inspiration from some of the best games out there: The original X-Com, Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat and Jagged Alliance.",

        "descripcion": "From Valve (the creators of Counter-Strike, Half-Life and more) comes Left 4 Dead, a co-op action horror game for the PC and Xbox 360 that casts up to four players in an epic struggle for survival against swarming zombie hordes and terrifying mutant monsters. Set in the immediate aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, L4D's survival co-op mode lets you blast a path through the infected in four unique \u201cmovies,\u201d guiding your survivors across the rooftops of an abandoned metropolis, through rural ghost towns and pitch-black forests in your quest to escape a devastated Ground Zero crawling with infected enemies. Each 'movie' is comprised of five large maps, and can be played by one to four human players, with an emphasis on team-based strategy and objectives. New technology dubbed 'the AI Director' is used to generate a unique gameplay experience every time you play. The Director tailors the frequency and ferocity of the zombie attacks to your performance, putting you in the middle of a fast-paced, but not overwhelming, Hollywood horror movie. Addictive single player, co-op, and multiplayer action gameplay from the makers of Counter-Strike and Half-Life Versus Mode lets you compete four-on-four with friends, playing as a human trying to get rescued, or as a zombie boss monster that will stop at nothing to destroy them. See how long you and your friends can hold out against the infected horde in the new Survival Mode An advanced AI director dynamically creates intense and unique experiences every time the game is played 20 maps, 10 weapons and unlimited possibilities in four sprawling 'movies' Matchmaking, stats, rankings, and awards system drive collaborative play Designer's Commentary allows gamers to go 'behind the scenes' of the game Powered by Source and Steam THE SACRIFICE 'The Sacrifice\u201d is the new add-on for Left 4 Dead. 'The Sacrifice' is the prequel to 'The Passing,' and takes place from the L4D Survivors' perspective as they make their way South. In addition to advancing the story, 'The Sacrifice' introduces a new style finale featuring 'Sacrificial Gameplay' where players get to decide who will give their life so the others may live. In The Sacrifice for Left 4 Dead owners receive 'The Sacrifice' campaign playable in Campaign, Versus, and Survival modes.",

        "descripcion": "Special Editions About the Game Colonize Mars and discover her secrets, with minimal casualties. Welcome Home! The time has come to stake your claim on the Red Planet and build the first functioning human colonies on Mars! All you need are supplies, oxygen, decades of training, experience with sandstorms, and a can-do attitude to discover the purpose of those weird black cubes that appeared out of nowhere. With a bit of sprucing up, this place is going to be awesome! Surviving Mars is a sci-fi city builder all about colonizing Mars and surviving the process. Choose a space agency for resources and financial support before determining a location for your colony. Build domes and infrastructure, research new possibilities and utilize drones to unlock more elaborate ways to shape and expand your settlement. Cultivate your own food, mine minerals or just relax by the bar after a hard day\u2019s work. Most important of all, though, is keeping your colonists alive. Not an easy task on a strange new planet. There will be challenges to overcome. Execute your strategy and improve your colony\u2019s chances of survival while unlocking the mysteries of this alien world. Are you ready? Mars is waiting for you. Main Features: Building on a planet not fit for human life challenges you to build a smart, functional colony. Bad planning isn\u2019t about traffic jams, it\u2019s about survival of your colonists. You really don\u2019t want rolling blackouts in a city constructed in a place without oxygen. Each colonist is a unique individual with problems and strengths that influence the needs and behavior of the other colonists. Things can get really interesting if your chief scientists develops alcoholism after one too many long nights in the lab. Retro-futuristic super structures housing colonists, factories and commercial buildings with their own \u201cneighborhood personality.\u201d Create colonies that value science over everything else, while tired workers drink their pay away at a local bar, or attempt a utopia among the stars. Inspired by the classic sci-fi of Asimov and Clarke, Surviving Mars holds many secrets. During each playthrough players may encounter one of Mars\u2019 individually crafted mysteries. Uncovering these secrets might bring your colony great fortune, or terrible ruin. What is that sphere that manifested itself outside colony HUB B, and is it friendly? Combine static and random research through experimentation, which allows for a different experience for each journey through the game. Attain new scientific breakthroughs by exploring the uncharted terrain of Mars's surface. A sleek, modern take on the bright futurism of the 1960s. A time of exploration and adventure. Craft your own fantastic buildings, parks or even a mystery to share through Surviving Mars\u2019s extensive and convenient modding tools. Share your finest creations with the community to build the perfect society.",

New Multiplayer Training Missions! To help skill up new players, we have added a new \u2018Training\u2019 tab to the multiplayer screen, under which are three missions to teach rookie commanders some of the techniques they will need to survive in online battles. Featuring an all new environment and SFX, these missions teach AA defense skills, rush building and structural durability. In addition to this, players can create their own training missions and upload them via the Steam Workshop. _______________________________ Tons of Guns This major free update adds two tech buildings which allow commanders access to six formidable new weapons. The Armoury unlocks Flak guns to clear the skies of enemy projectiles, and EMP rockets to power down enemy tech, both of which can be upgraded to the Shotgun and twin Rocket launcher, respectively. The classic Cannon is now found in the new Munitions Plant, where it is joined by it's little brother, the burst-firing 20mm Cannon. The Factory now produces two beam weapons, the classic Plasma Laser and the new Firebeam, great for penetrating fortifications to ignite them from within. _______________________________ Repair Station In an effort to reduce APM and to add another element of strategy, we have created the Repair Station. Available as a device built directly from the Reactor, the Repair Station repairs damage to surrounding building materials and devices as and when they are damaged in exchange for an ongoing resource cost. Multiple Repair Stations can be built at a time, but should be placed with care to maximise their coverage, while also ensuring they don\u2019t put too much of a strain on your economy. Ranked Multiplayer Players who opt to play ranked matches will have the result of their battles figure into their score, and their rank will be adjusted accordingly on the public Leaderboard. Seasons last for two months, with medals given out to the table toppers in the 1v1 arena. _______________________________ BPO Commanders Three Black Penguin Oil commanders enter the fray, bringing new abilities to open up fresh multiplayer strategies. Will you choose the self-propelled projectile obsessed Seep with his extra-fast missiles, the insidious Shockenaugh and her explosive barrel incursions, or the all-or-nothing Scattershot with his focus fire?",

        "descripcion": "FREE TO PLAY / About the Game BE YOUR OWN WEAPON OF WAR Welcome to the year 3015! It\u2019s a hell of a time to be alive. Humanity has colonized thousands of star systems spanning a vast region of space known as the Inner Sphere. The golden age of cooperation and advancement is now a distant memory, and humanity has once again splintered into disparate factions all vying for supremacy. In the midst of these Succession Wars, power hungry Mercenaries like yourself are in a privileged position to capitalize big time. It\u2019s dangerous work but that\u2019s why you\u2019re here, right? If you\u2019ve got an itch to blast, wreck, stomp and go all out ballistic, step inside and become your own weapon of war! STORY As the inheritor of a once-prominent Mercenary company, reborn in the flames of its near destruction at the hands of conspiring factions, your quest for glory and revenge will stretch light-years as you chase threads of interstellar intrigue along your journey to becoming an elite MechWarrior and mercenary commander. THE INNER SPHERE Home to thousands of star systems and an array of stunning biomes, the Inner Sphere is alive with activity, purpose, consequence, and variety. Systems will be captured and reclaimed, major events will unfold, and new technologies will come to light. The rigors of war will be seen with each passing week as your relationships with the various factions fluctuate according to the relentless Succession Wars and your choices as the leader of a Mercenary outfit. GAMEPLAY The battlefields of the future are dominated by BattleMechs, hulking machines of war capable of leveling entire cities. As a BattleMech pilot you\u2019ll rain havoc upon enemy \u2018Mechs and targets, including tanks, ground vehicles, aircraft, advanced defenses, and reinforced bases. Few things can withstand the power of a \u2018Mech for long, and the worlds of the Inner Sphere are veritable playgrounds of destruction awaiting your shielding defense or crushing devastation. BATTLEMECHS 'With over 50 unique \u2018Mech chassis and hundreds of sub-variants, all fully-realized with high-fidelity models, damage states, and equipment, no two \u2018Mechs are the same! Whether acquired from scouring the markets of the Inner Sphere for rare and valuable chassis and equipment, or salvaging directly from the wreckage of your annihilated enemies and the spoils of war, the maintenance and operation of your BattleMechs will be vital to your success both as a MechWarrior and a Mercenary outfit commander.' THE MERC LIFE Off the battlefield, as the leader of a Mercenary company you will need to manage all the key components of running a unit. You\u2019ll need to maintain and acquire \u2018Mechs and equipment, hire and field MechWarriors from throughout the Inner Sphere to join you on the battlefield, and manage your relationships with the Great Houses of the Inner Sphere, all of whom are vying for your contribution to their staggering war efforts. Of course, with each Contract comes negotiation, and with each victory comes consequence. OTHER FEATURES With the vast scope of the Inner Sphere and its complex system of world generation providing huge variety and replayability, the MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries experience offers no end. Outside the campaign, a fully-featured Instant Action system will allow you to customize and kick off isolated missions at any time, free from campaign restrictions. With four-player co-op supported both within the campaign and the Instant Action system, you can experience the full breadth of the MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries universe alongside your friends. Mods extend your game even further! Unlock the boundless creativity of the community to alter and expand the game in amazing ways. With a full editor and interface supporting gameplay mods out of the box your creativity will know no limits.",

        "descripcion": "The Next Installment to the Award-Winning RTS. While many were hopeful that diplomacy would finally end the war, differing opinions on what should be done, along with the depleted power of the controlling factions, has led to a splintering of the groups involved. The loyalist members of the Trader Emergency Coalition adopt a policy of isolation, focusing on enhanced defenses to ride out the rest of the war. Those who rebel against the coalition take on a purely militant view, coming to the opinion that the only way to bring peace is by ultimately crushing all who oppose them - especially xenos. For the first time in their history, the war creates a schism in the Advent Unity. The loyalists seek to continue their policy of revenge against the Traders, and to assimilate all others to the Unity\u2019s influence. However, others amongst the Advent suspect that a corrupting influence from within has diverted the Unity from its proper destiny. The divide created in the Vasari Empire is less pronounced, but just as severe to their people. With the Vasari now practically frantic to move on to new space, the loyalist faction abandons cooperation and decides to take the resources they need by any means necessary. Having accepted the need to work together, the rebel faction feels that their best chance for survival is to work with the other races and bring them along to flee the approaching enemy. Take the battle for galactic supremacy to its ultimate level in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion \u2013 a standalone RT4X game that combines the tactics of real-time strategy with the depth of the 4X genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate). Key features: New Factions : Decide whether to play as a Loyalist or Rebel \u2013 each unlocks new technologies, ships and play styles for each race. New Titan Class Warships : Mighty titans enter the fray of the war to tip the scales of power. Each faction may field their own unique titan, drawing upon unique strengths and abilities on the battlefield. New and Updated Capital Ships : A new capital ship joins the fleet for each race to offer even more tactical options. Additionally, all existing capital ships have been upgraded to four levels for their abilities, allowing players to focus their ships along specific strengths. New Corvette Class Ships : Small and maneuverable, each faction has developed a new light attack craft to harass enemy forces. Updated Visuals : Updated graphics, particle effects, lighting and shadows, race specific UI and other enhancements make the Sins\u2019 universe look better than ever. New Victory Conditions : Take multiple paths to victory including \u2013 Military, Diplomatic, Research, Last Flagship Standing, Last Capital Standing and Occupation. New Audio : More than 60 minutes of original music, countless new sound effects and dozens of new voice overs help bring the drama of battle to new levels of immersion. Tutorials : New and updated tutorials make it easy for both experienced and new players to quickly start building their own solar empire. Plus, a number of optimizations that provide better performance than ever before! ",

It includes the main game, season pass and all exclusive content at a discounted price. ABOUT THE GAME THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Frostpunk, the newest title from the creators of This War of Mine, is a society survival game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler\u2019s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state. What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process? MAKE THE LAW Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment \u2013 the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there\u2019s no turning back. WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES Some of your decisions will seem small \u2013 like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction \u2013 but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden. DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don\u2019t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society\u2019s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands. PLAY ENDLESSLY Frostpunk Endless Mode grants you unlimited replayability for the game. Play on 8 various maps, with different terrain, weather conditions and challenges to face. We know that different people look for different experiences and that\u2019s why there are 3 modes to play in Endless Mode. Endurance will be an ultimate test to your building, managing and survival skills in the harshest conditions. Builders, where there is no generator available from the start, which creates a different type of challenge. And last but not least, Serenity which is focused on enjoying the art of building the city itself, without unnecessary pressure. ",

        "descripcion": "In Mini Metro, you take on the task of designing the subway layout for a rapidly expanding city. Your city starts with three stations. Draw routes between these stations to connect them with subway lines. Commuters travel along your lines to get around the city as fast as they can. Each station can only hold a handful of waiting commuters so your subway network will need to be well-designed to avoid delays. The city is growing. More stations are opening, and commuters are appearing faster. The demands on your network are ever-increasing. You'll be constantly redesigning your lines to maximise efficiency. The new assets you earn every week will help immensely \u2014 as long as they're used wisely. Eventually your network will fail. Stations will open too quickly. Commuters will crowd the platforms. How long the city keeps moving is up to you. Key Features Compelling, constructive, hectic, relaxed gameplay. If that makes sense. It doesn't though, aye? You just gotta play it. Three game modes: Normal for quick scored games, Endless for stress-free sandbox play, and Extreme for the ultimate challenge. Build your metro exactly how you want to with the all-new Creative mode. Over two dozen real-world cities! Design subways for London, Paris, New York City, Osaka, Saint Petersburg, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Auckland and many more! Each has a unique colour theme, set of obstacles, and pace. Random city growth, so each game plays out differently. A strategy that proved successful last game may not help you in the next. Each game's map is a work of art, built by you in the classic abstract subway style of Harry Beck. If you think it's a keeper, save it, tweet it, show it off, or make it your desktop background! Responsive soundtrack created by your metro system, engineered by Disasterpeace. Colorblind and night modes. Trains! Did we mention them yet?

Choose your role and fight across high altitude battlefields - this is WW1 as you haven't experienced it before. About the Game The game takes place on the Western Front between 1914 and 1918, in one of the bloodiest conflicts in world history - inspired by the infamous Battle of Verdun in 1916. Verdun is the first multiplayer FPS set in a realistic World War One setting, the game which started the WW1 Game series. The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. The game offers 4 distinct game-modes with many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The dynamic Frontlines game mode features 64 players taking turns to go over the top and attempt to capture the opposing trench line. Verdun key features include: Experience World War One gameplay: Accurate weaponry with realistic bullet physics, skill based weapon handling, poisonous gas with a claustrophobic gas mask experience, horrendous gore effects, and ferocious artillery barrages Tactical squad-based FPS: 15 distinctive squad types representing soldiers from 5+ countries, each with distinct weapons and equipment True trench warfare: Real-time dynamic frontline with momentum based attack and counter-attack gameplay Authentic World War 1 setting: Typical WW1 music and style, historical battlefields representing the most active parts of the Western Front Challenging game modes: team-based Frontlines, tactical Attrition, skill-based Rifle Deathmatch, and relentless Squad Defense WW1 on the Western Front The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with. Battle your way across no man\u2019s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn\u2019t for the faint hearted! Authentic World War One Setting The WW1 Game Series currently includes Verdun, Tannenberg (set on the Eastern Front), and the upcoming Isonzo, which is set on the Italian Front. These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. For Verdun, we carried out extensive field research at the battlefield itself and were advised by knowledgeable historians to make sure the individual elements in Verdun are as historically accurate as it can get. Uniforms have been recreated to the tiniest detail, the weapons are modeled to exact references and the maps use realistic props and terrain layouts. Everything in the game has been tailored to recreate the grim atmosphere so typical of WW1, from the immersive interface and war torn maps to realistic sounds and voices that evoke the feeling of actually being there in the mud covered trenches, peering out over no man's land in search of the enemy.

Assetto Corsa Competizione will feature Blancpain GT Series\u2019 2018 and 2019 seasons. Assetto Corsa Competizione is born from KUNOS Simulazioni's long-term experience, and it takes full advantage of Unreal Engine 4 to ensure photorealistic weather conditions and graphics, night races, motion capture animations, reaching a new standard in terms of driving realism and immersion, thanks to its further improved tyre and aerodynamic models.

BLANCPAIN GT SERIES Encouraged by the success of the Blancpain Endurance Series, which after its creation in 2011 quickly became the global reference for GT racing, world-renowned Swiss watch manufacturer Blancpain and the SRO Motorsports Group decided at the end of 2013 to extend their partnership to the Blancpain Sprint Series. From 2015, teams and drivers were also given the opportunity to compete for an overall Blancpain GT Series title. Varied grids were the result, with a host of respected GT teams and drivers at the start of each race. The Blancpain GT Series also saw an influx of young and talented drivers, making it a worldwide benchmark in GT3 racing. With both the Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup and Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup now sharing the same driver categories and points system, the ten-round Blancpain GT Series season \u2013 comprising five sprint events and five endurance events \u2013 crowns the world\u2019s most complete GT drivers. A Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup event consists of two races of one hour each, while the Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup races range from three-hour events through a 1000 km race to the season highlight of the Total 24 Hours of Spa, one of the world\u2019s leading 24-hour races.",

        "descripcion": "Modern society owes much to a mystical technology known as \u201corbal energy.\u201d Fifty years ago, during what\u2019s come to be known as the \u201cOrbal Revolution,\u201d the invention of this technology and the \u201corbments\u201d developed from it led to a period of rapid human advancement, birthing innovations of all shapes and sizes -- not the least of which was the airliner, or \u201corbalship\u201d industry. Although the positive impact of this revolution is obvious, every coin has a flipside; for every beneficial device developed with these new materials, so too were advanced weapons and other implements of war. Thus, the land became mired with turmoil, and remains in such a state even now. Enter, the bracers: an organization established to serve as police and intermediaries alike, holding above all else the peace and safety of the lands under their jurisdiction. Whenever a citizen is in need of assistance, he or she may place a request at the local Bracer Guild -- and be it monster extermination, crime prevention or even peace talks among warring nations, the bracers will do whatever they can to resolve the matter cleanly and efficiently. Some matters require a gentler touch than others, however. When an orbalship transporting a legendary 'S-rank' bracer named Cassius Bright suddenly goes missing, said bracer's daughter, Estelle, and adoptive son, Joshua, must join forces in search of him across the entire Kingdom of Liberl. And what they find along the way could change both of their lives forever... Hailed as one of the largest, longest and most meticulously detailed turn-based JRPG series of all time, this first chapter in the ongoing Trails saga sets the stage for what's quickly become Ys developer Nihon Falcom's most popular and best-selling franchise in their entire 30+ year history. Introducing people, places, ideas, events and lore that rival in complexity those of even the most highly-regarded fantasy epics in literature, the care and attention given to each and every NPC, location and historical in-game event is what sets The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky apart from its contemporaries. Come join Estelle, Joshua, Scherazard, Olivier and the rest of the cast as they uncover the secret underbelly of Liberl in their first 50+ hour masterpiece, and see what Japanese gamers have been raving about for over ten years. Key Features: The original version of the first chapter in this historical series, featuring strategic turn-based combat with unmatched customization. Over 50 hours of gameplay on average, with countless side-quests, collectibles and secrets to encourage replay. A vast world where every NPC has a name and personality, every town has its own unique politics and economic concerns, and no detail is ever trivial. Support for a wide variety of fullscreen and widescreen resolutions, including true 1080p HD. Fully adjustable controls supporting virtually any USB gamepad, as well as a standard keyboard and mouse setup. Over two dozen unique Steam Achievements, Steam Cloud support and Steam Trading Cards featuring gorgeous anime-style art from the franchise's original artists. Numerous updates previously seen only in the handheld version, including: - Selectable difficulty level and new game+ features on subsequent playthroughs - Full voice-acting during combat - 'Retry Offset' feature to lower the difficulty of battle with each attempt if desired ",

        "descripcion": "Check out more games from Fulqrum Publishing / / / Check out even more games from Fulqrum Publishing / / About the Game Space Rangers HD: A War Apart remasters and expands the world of the cult classic Space Rangers 2. The game is developed by the SNK-Games team in close cooperation with fans of the series. The biggest of the improved features is a new scenario dedicated to the pirates threatening the galaxy. While the Coalition spends all of its resources to fight the Dominators (sentient machines who seek to eradicate all life), the pirates have united under the banner of a mysterious leader. Under this new master they have begun their own guerrilla war to seize power in the weakened Galaxy. Players can now choose with whom to deal, the Dominators or the pirates, or both at the same time. If you choose the latter path, you will receive new story and side quests, new goals and promotions. After winning one of the wars, you can either finish the game or continue playing to win another. Players begin their pirate career as the lowest of the low, and will make their way to the top of the pirate hierarchy, completing story missions and learning new information about the organization and its unknown leader whose actions threaten the very existence of the Coalition of sentient species. All player actions affect what kind of place the Galaxy will be at the end, with the victorious Coalition that managed to overcome its enemies or with a collapsed alliance from both external Dominator and internal pirate pressures. The game has received a major technical overhaul in addition to the addition of new content. All of the main menu, loading screens, planet and space station vistas were reworked. Now you can choose a display resolution of up to 1920\u00d71200 and planetary battles employ modern render technologies. Key Features: New pirate subplot. After completing any one of the story branches a player can either end the game, or continue playing to complete another branch. the player\u2019s actions influence the entire Galaxy, while the balance in either of wars may be tipped not only by the player, but by AI actions as well. No two playthroughs will be the same. Major technical overhaul. Display resolutions up to 1920\u00d71200, multi-core processors, Windows\u00ae 7, and anti-aliasing in 3D planetary battles are now fully supported. Extended soundtrack means you\u2019ll hear more than 15 completely new musical themes specially created for deeper immersion into the amazing Space Rangers universe. Other improvements include more than 10 new text adventures, 15+ planetary battle maps, 20+ government missions, unique non-story events, new equipment and micromodules, access to all hyperspace engagements from the main menu and more!

About the Game Unite Humanity - Shape Society The climate change was a catalyst for a succession of events that led to the destruction of our world; rising sea levels have inundated the coasts. Only you can help humanity survive by leading your band of survivors on a path to redemption. Starting with a lost bunch of survivors, you need to scavenge resources, rediscover technology and maintain the peace between differing factions as you strive to rebuild society. Explore and Exploit The world - as you know it - has gone, replaced by islands, swamps and isolated groups of survivors. Gathering scarce resources, you need to explore the world - island by island - helping those you can and dealing with those who do not share your vision of the future. Grow Your Colony There's more to a city than just people. Food, shelter, water, health, security - the list is long and varied. Technology to be researched along a branching Tech-Tree, buildings upgraded and specialists to train. It's down to you to make sure all these needs are fulfilled; a job made all the harder with limited resources, space and labour to complete these tasks. You Are the Law A society is only as good as its laws; it's up to you to define them. Will you usher in a new utopian age of equality or is your future a benign dictatorship? Not every group shares your vision and the choices you make can have a profound impact on the future of your settlement. A common goal will make your society more productive than one at loggerheads with itself; you need to define and choose your legal evolution and which route to follow on the Law-Tree but - as with all things - there are always consequences. Unlimited Playthroughs Each game is different; maps, events and make up of the world are randomly generated, allowing unique playthroughs every time. ",

The new Arenas Expansion, features 9 dynamic locations packed with enemies, 5 game modes and 45 challenges in an explosive mix of film action. Face ever more intense combat moments, engage with the environment in an advanced way and push your Kung Fu training to its limits. About the Game Whether you choose to play as a male or a female character, in Sifu, you will ponder that question on your path for revenge, hunting down your family\u2019s assassins. One against all, you have no allies, countless enemies, and a mysterious amulet to bring you back to life every time you die. Yet, be warned! Your secret weapon comes with a hefty price to pay: aging and its consequences. Your enemies don\u2019t wait their turn, and they don\u2019t broadcast their intent. Dodge, parry, strike, use combos and be like water making its way through captivating environments. Learn how to master your art, whether by fighting through the underbelly of a nightclub, scrambling through a refined gallery to avoid getting surrounded, or vertically navigating a towering office building. Careful positioning and clever use of the environment to your advantage are key to your survival. Use everything at your disposal: throwable objects, makeshift weapons, windows, and ledges... The odds are stacked against you, and you will be offered no mercy. Kung Fu is mastery through practice, a path for both the body and the mind. Learn from your mistakes, unlock unique skills, and find the strength to master the devastating techniques of Pak Mei Kung Fu.",

Recruit cute card companions, elemental items and equip powerful charms to aid in your fight against the Wildfrost Choose your Leader from a variety of tribes, each with randomized skills and stats Master a dynamic \u2018counter\u2019 system to put your strategic skills to the test Expand and develop the hub town of Snowdwell between runs Unlock new cards, events, customisation options and more! Endless replayability with daily runs and challenges! About the Game The sun has frozen over... The world has succumbed to the Wildfrost. Now only Snowdwell and its survivors stand as the last bastion against an eternal winter... Build up a deck of powerful card companions and elemental items, as you battle to banish the frost once and for all! Perfect your card battling and deck-building skills, and set out on a quest to bring an end to The Wildfrost! Begin each journey with your chosen tribe Leader, each gifted with different randomised skills and stats, before mapping out your chosen path into the unforgiving frosty landscape. Rescue and recruit frozen companions you find along the way, unearth lost treasures, and spend your hard-earned blings with travelling merchants. The decisions you make and routes you take during each run will help craft a powerful deck, unique to you each time you play. Collect a huge array of cute, but mighty card companions, as well as handy items and clunker cards to aid you in battle. Experiment with different elemental card combinations to find your winning formula. Your companion cards aren\u2019t just disposable minions for dealing out damage; upgrade and customise your favourites by adding wobbly charms to enhance their powers, making your deck a powerful (and adorable) force to be reckoned with! Plan ahead with the help of a dynamic counter system to map out your next move and fend off frosty foes. While Wildfrost battles are turn-based, cards don\u2019t attack every turn. Instead they have a \u2018counter\u2019 which counts down the amount of turns until they\u2019re ready to automatically make their move! By keeping an eye on enemy monsters\u2019 counters, you can plot ahead your perfect play. Buff your companions? Stall an enemy attack? Or maybe count down your own timer to wreak havoc fast! It\u2019s up to you to strategically turn the tide in your favour. Need a rest? Take shelter in the cosy town of Snowdwell. Here survivors have gathered to keep warm using the power of the Luminice, a giant shard of hot ice. As you progress after each run you\u2019ll be able to return and gradually help expand the hub town itself, constructing buildings such as a Pet Shop, Inventors Hut and more! These new areas will unlock fun and useful new things to use during your adventures, with new cards, tribes, cosmetics, challenges to complete, and events to encounter. Think you\u2019ve defeated the Frost Guardian? Even after you\u2019ve beaten back the frost, Wildfrost offers endless replayability, with daily runs and challenges! Test your skills and improve your score! ",

Along with timed hits, combat features multi-character combo attacks, boosting, and a strategic 'locks' system offering options to play with different damage types in order to hinder enemies while they are channeling powerful attacks or spells, all in an immersive take on the genre; no random encounters, no transitions to separate battlefields, and no grinding.

Dozens of original characters and story arcs will take you on a captivating journey. Sometimes epic, sometimes silly, and other times emotional, Sea of Stars does its RPG duty of exploring classic themes of adventure and friendship, while also being chock-full of the unexpected twists and events you\u2019d expect from a Sabotage production. There are many ways to hang out in the world of Sea of Stars if you feel the need for a change of pace in your adventures.

        "nombre": "For The King II",
        "descripcion": "Roadmap Our commitment to For The King II will span many years. Our ambition has always been to create a game that will grow and evolve with you, expanding with new adventures and new ways to play as the community grows within it. We plan to bring significant free updates to the game to expand the world and provide new game modes to enjoy solo or with your friends, as well as frequent and significant paid expansions that will provide new adventures, items, weapons and classes to enjoy. About the Game Once beloved by her people, Queen Rosomon has turned against her subjects, casting them into servitude in the darkness of Fahrul\u2019s mines whilst building alliances with sinister and malevolent forces. Gather your party in four player co-op or adventure alone through Fahrul as you risk everything to fight the tyrannical queen and bring an end to her oppressive reign. From the creators of For The King, the much-loved RPG that blends roguelite and tabletop gameplay comes a new chapter in Fahrul\u2019s history, designed on an updated engine bringing innovation and gameplay refinement for returning heroes and new adventurers alike. For The King II is easy for anyone to pick up and play, but takes skill, patience, and strategic excellence to master whilst remaining infinitely replayable with a procedurally generated map that ensures no two playthroughs will ever be the same. Unique yet familiar dice roll inspired movement, encounter and combat mechanics add even more spontaneity and variety as your fortunes rise and fall on the roll of the dice. For The King II provides a complete campaign with over 30 hours of gameplay, split into 5 separate adventures, each narratively linked. The journey is long and the path is treacherous but fear not, if your party fails you will start stronger and wiser on your next playthrough with better starting items to draft into your loadout. Create your party from 12 unique character classes, each with their own unique perks, strengths and playstyles. From the heavy-handed hitter of The Blacksmith, to the wily potion-wielding Alchemist, you choose which characters will take on the fearsome Queensguard and the combat strategies that will ensure success. Introduce new characters to your party with mercenaries and companions that enable you to pluck wild beasts from the forest floor and recruit ruthless mercenaries from local taverns (for a price of course) to bolster your ranks in times of trouble. Traverse Fahrul solo or with up-to three friends in four-player co-op. As a solo player you can control all characters in your party, giving you complete ownership of the campaign map and combat strategy whilst in four-player co-op you must coordinate and negotiate with your party members. Play online multiplayer with your friends controlling your own character(s) or play offline co-op on the same PC. Offline co-op supports multiple controllers; each controller will have input control on everyone\u2019s turn.

Long ago - when ancient ruins were once flourishing civilizations and their populace lived in idyllic bliss - a mystical star governed all. Loyal disciples, called Six-Sided Oracles, were blessed by their star, granting them the strength to seal away the gift of heavenly bodies within mystic relics. All was perfect and harmonious, until that one fateful day - The Crimson Dawn Cataclysm. A ferocious inferno sundered down from the sky, engulfing the entirety of the star system, crumbling the foundations of their society and corrupting the souls of the weak-willed. The disciples of the star were lost to the chaos - their creations scattered across a vast world of ruin. Could there still exist those who were capable of wielding their power? Eons later, descendants of the Six-Sided Oracles embark on a journey to finish the failed battle that their predecessors started and save their star system. ",
